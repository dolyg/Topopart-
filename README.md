# Topopart+
It's my implementation topopart+ with 2024EDAcompetition with http://eda.icisc.cn/

The project is modified based on BWbwchen's TopoPart,But I don`t know how to use Github to show its relationship with his project.

The project is a demo,in my project you can see how I implement the topopart+

And the project also show my mind that how I ensure the partition is legally valid,u can see the refine_CV() and Force_CV() to understand my ideas.

And i am a beginner and i don`t know how to use github professionally.

I would appreciate it if you could give more advice.
